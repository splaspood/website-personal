Just a short note "for now"...   I figure once every few years I should make another post.   When I
went to migrate this blog off it's previous VM to a new kubernetes managed VM I have recently
provisioned, I found that I didn't really want to deal with ruby just to update my blog and besides it
appeared Jekyll hadn't been touched in nine years!   Think of all the features I've been missing out on!

Hugo appears to be the new hottness, and in Go so I don't need to have the ruby environment.

Maybe I'll detail my new setup in later posts.  (haha)
